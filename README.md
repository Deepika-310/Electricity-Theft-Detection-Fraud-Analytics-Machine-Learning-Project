# Electricity-Theft-Detection-Fraud-Analytics-Machine-Learning-Project
Built a machine learning system to detect electricity theft using real-world Indian power consumption data. 
Cleaned and transformed large time-series meter readings into meaningful features such as sudden consumption drop, abnormal usage spikes, and voltage anomalies. Trained Random Forest classification model and evaluated using confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F1-score, achieving ~85% accuracy in identifying fraudulent consumers while handling high class imbalance.

Tech Stack: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib
